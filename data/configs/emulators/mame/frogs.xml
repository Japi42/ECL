It really was a three way joystick, basically a 4-way stick without a down.  The button flicked out your frog's tongue. *update*    I looked into this.  This game was generally hacked into an old frogger cab.  The jump button was hacked into the 4way up and a tongue button was added.  However mame uses a two way joystick and two buttons to emulate the hardware (which is correct input wise) so we reflect these constants in the database.  As it's sorta a bootleg there isn't much point in worrying about control accuracy.
