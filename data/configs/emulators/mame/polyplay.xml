Note that this game didn't have any labels.  The poly play system was the second East-German arcade machine.  Quite, frankly it was a slapped-together piece of crap.  It used inferior russian computer hardware, an old television converted to rgb and a cabient made out of chip-board laminated to look like fake wood.  We use the terms 'arcade contols' in a generic sense on this one.  The joystick and button were salvaged from industrial machines and are nothing like real arcade controls.
