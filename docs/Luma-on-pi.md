The easiest way to use ECL is by setting up a Raspberry Pi Zero-W as a controller for all the OLEDs, and have the host that is running your emulators send a request to the pi to change the labels.

## Hardware needed:

Raspberry Pi Zero-W
Adafruit Perma-Proto Hat (full size, not for the Zero)
A pile of SSD1331 OLED displays
A pile of 6-pin dupont cables (female-to-female)
A pile of 1-pin dupont cables (female-to-female)

## Wiring

## Software

Install Raspbian on the pi-zero.
